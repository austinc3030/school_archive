4/14/2023,Bot users added to all new apps,If your app doesn't need or want a bot user associated with it. you can refrain from adding the bot scope when installing your app.,
4/6/2023,Interaction Channel Data,Interactions now contain a channel field which is a partial channel object and guaranteed to contain id and type. We recommend that you begin using this channel field to identify the source channel of the interaction. and may deprecate the existing channel_id field in the future. See the interaction documentation for more details.,
2/24/2023,Add Auto Moderation custom_message Action Metadata Field,Add new custom_message action metadata for the BLOCK_MESSAGE action type. You can now specify a custom string for every Auto Moderation rule that will be shown to members whenever the rule blocks their message.

2/10/2023,Update to Locked Threads,Currently. threads in Discord (including forum posts) can either be archived or both locked and archived. Starting on 03 6,2023 . threads will be able to be locked without being archived. which will slightly change the meaning of the locked field.
2/10/2023,Update to Locked Threads,locked currently indicates that a thread cannot be reopened by a user without the MANAGE_THREADS (1 << 34) permission. but it doesn't restrict user activity within active (meaning non-archived) threads. After this change. users (including bot users) without the MANAGE_THREADS permission will be more restricted in locked threads. Users won't be able to create or update messages in locked threads. or update properties like its title or tags. Additionally. some user activity like deleting messages and adding or removing reactions will only be allowed in locked threads if that thread is also active (or un-archived).,
2/10/2023,Update to Locked Threads,If a user or bot user has the MANAGE_THREADS permission. they will still be able to make changes to the thread and messages. The upcoming change does not affect the meaning of the archived field or the behavior of a thread that is both locked and archived.,
2/10/2023,Update to Locked Threads,If your app is interacting with threads (including forum posts). it should check the state of the locked and/or archived field for the thread to understand which actions it can or cannot perform. It should also be prepared to handle any errors that it may receive when a thread is locked.,

The VIEW_AUDIT_LOG permission is required in order to receive these events. and the GUILD_MODERATION intent needs to be set when connecting to the gateway.,
1/9/2023,Thread Member Details and Pagination,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. A new member field was added to the thread member object. member is a guild member object that will be included within returned thread member objects when the new with_member field is set to true in the List Thread Members (GET /channels/<channel_id>/thread-members) and Get Thread Member (GET /channels/<channel_id>/thread-members/<user_id>) endpoints.,
1/9/2023,Thread Member Details and Pagination,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Setting with_member to true will also enable pagination for the List Thread Members endpoint. When the results are paginated. you can use the new after and limit fields to fetch additional thread members and limit the number of thread members returned. By default. limit is 100.,
1/9/2023,Thread Member Details and Pagination,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Starting in API v11. List Thread Members (GET /channels/<channel_id>/thread-members) will always return paginated results. regardless of whether with_member is passed or not.,
12/13/2022,Add Default Layout setting for Forum channels,default_forum_layout is an optional field in the channel object that indicates the default layout for posts in a forum channel.

11/17/2022,Upcoming Application Command Permission Changes,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Based on feedback. weâ€™re updating permissions for application commands to simplify permission management and to make command permissions more closely resemble other permissions systems in Discord. ,
11/17/2022,Upcoming Application Command Permission Changes,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Server admins can begin to opt-in to the command permission changes outlined here on a per-server basis starting on 12 16,2022. However. changes will not be applied to all servers until late 01 or early 02. info. Current permissions behavior is documented in the application commands documentation and in the changelog for the previous permissions update. These changes are focused on how configured permissions are used by Discord clients. so most apps will be unaffected. However. if your app uses the Update Permissions endpoint (PUT /applications/<application_id>/guilds/<guild_id>/commands/<command_id>/permissions). you may need to make updates and should read these changes carefully.
11/17/2022,Types of command permission configurations,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. info. The following information isnâ€™t changing. but itâ€™s helpful context to understand the changes. Discordâ€™s clients determine whether a user can see or invoke a command based on three different permission configurations: Command-level permissions are set up by an admin for a specific command in their server. These permissions affect only a specific command. App-level permissions are set up by an admin for a specific app in their server. These permissions affect all commands for an app. default_member_permissions are set up by an app when creating or updating a command. default_member_permissions apply to that command in all servers (unless an override exists). More information about default_member_permissions is in the documentation. The concepts of these permission configurations are not changing. But then of course. the question becomesâ€¦,
11/17/2022,Types of command permission configurations,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. What's changing?. There are two changes around command permissions: The logic used to apply permission configurations to a user in a given context within Discord clients. New APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_V2 guild feature flag to indicate whether that guild is using the old permissions logic or the new (upcoming) logic. Let's go deeper into both of these.,
11/17/2022,How permission configurations are applied in Discord,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Current behavior: Currently. these systems are mutually-exclusive. meaning that only one type of permission configuration is used to determine whether a user can invoke a command. With this current system. there is a clear hierarchy: command-level permission configurations take precedence (if present). then app-level permission configurations (if present). and finally default_member_permissions if neither are present. The implication of the current permissions system means that: If any command-level permissions are configured. all app-level permissions and default_member_permissions are ignored for that command. If any app-level permissions are configured. default_member_permissions is ignored for all of that appâ€™s commands. This system leads to unintentional permission escalations. and can force moderators to manually re-define their app-level configurations to make small tweaks on the command-level.,
11/17/2022,How permission configurations are applied in Discord,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Upcoming behavior: The new system removes the mutual exclusion aspect. meaning that the different types of permission configurations work together rather than independentlyâ€”specifically. more than one may be used to determine whether a user can invoke a command.,
11/17/2022,How permission configurations are applied in Discord,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Upcoming behavior: default_member_permissions continues to act as a â€œdefaultâ€ that a developer can set when creating or updating a command.,
11/17/2022,How permission configurations are applied in Discord,"danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Upcoming behavior: App-level permission configurations now act as the ""base"" configuration.",
11/17/2022,How permission configurations are applied in Discord,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Upcoming behavior: App-level configurations define who is allowed to use the app and where. These will work together with default_member_permissions. meaning if a user is granted access via an app-level permission configuration. they will still be restricted to the default_member_permissions for each command (by default). No more accidentally granting /ban which requires BAN_MEMBERS to @BotMemers just because you gave them access to the app!,
11/17/2022,How permission configurations are applied in Discord,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Upcoming behavior: Command-level permission configurations now act as an â€œoverrideâ€ of the app-level.,
11/17/2022,How permission configurations are applied in Discord,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Upcoming behavior: Command-level configurations override what is present at the app-level and any restrictions set by default_member_permissions. This means that an admin can explicitly grant a user access to a specific command even if they are denied access on the app-level or if they don't have permissions that meet that command's default_member_permissions. If a command-level configuration does not exist for the given context. the system will fall back to looking at the app-level configuration.,
11/17/2022,Flowchart for command permissions logic,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Below is a simplified flowchart that illustrates how permissions will be applied by the Discord client after the new changes take effect. !Flowchart with an overview of the new permissions configurations logic(new-permissions-flowchart.svg),
11/17/2022,APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_V2 Guild Feature,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. We added a new APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_V2 feature flag which indicates whether that server is using the current permissions logic. If the flag is present. that server is using the old command permissions behavior. If the flag is not present. that server has migrated from the old command permissions behavior to the new behavior.,
11/17/2022,Upcoming Application Command Permission Changes,Am I affected?. danger. This entry includes breaking changes. Your app will only be affected if it uses the PUT /applications/<application_id>/guilds/<guild_id>/commands/<command_id>/permissions endpoint. This is a pretty restricted endpoint used to manage and update application command permissions on behalf of admins. meaning that it requires the applications.commands.permissions.update scope. If your app doesnâ€™t use this endpoint. thereâ€™s nothing you need to prepare for these changes. If your app does use this endpoint. you should read the section on preparing for changes below.,
11/17/2022,Upcoming Application Command Permission Changes,How do I prepare for the changes?. danger. This entry includes breaking changes. To prepare for these changes. you should take two steps: Use the APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_V2 flag. Use this flag to determine which permissions logic that server is using. While the transition from the old behavior to the new behavior is happening. you may need two code paths depending on if the flag is present or not. py. if 'APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_V2' in guild.features:     Use current behaviors when interacting with endpoint. else:     Use new permissions behaviors when interacting with endpoint. info. If you donâ€™t have access to guild features already through Gateway events. you can fetch that information using the GET /guilds/<guild_idendpoint. Modify the behavior based on your use case. After you know what permissions behavior the server is using. you should update how you handle that server specifically. To understand what changes you need to make. you should look at the assumptions users have when your app updates their serverâ€™s commands permissions. Do you have a web dashboard where admins update permissions? If so. analyze the logic of that dashboard and what your permission configurations are trying to do to map them to the new permissions behavior. Do you document what your app is doing in regards to certain command permissions youâ€™re configuring on behalf of the admin? If so. map that documentation to the new behavior. If you are unsure. you can communicate with your admin users to ask if your new logic meets their expectations.,
11/17/2022,Upcoming Application Command Permission Changes,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. What happens if I donâ€™t update my app?. If your app is affected and you donâ€™t update it. permissions behavior that your app configures may not match what you or the users of your app expect.,
11/17/2022,Upcoming Application Command Permission Changes,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. How long do I have to update my app?,
11/17/2022,Upcoming Application Command Permission Changes,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. The new APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_V2 flag is already live. and you should start seeing it in guildsâ€™ feature flags.,
11/17/2022,Upcoming Application Command Permission Changes,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. The new permissions behavior will roll out on 12 16,2022. On this date. admins will begin to see a banner that allows them to optionally move their server to the new behavior.
11/17/2022,Upcoming Application Command Permission Changes,danger. This entry includes breaking changes. In late 01 or early 02. all servers will be migrated to the new behavior. We'll post another changelog at this point. at which time you can remove any logic around the old permissions behavior.,

Starting 07 18,2022. the name field for message interaction objects will now include subcommands and subcommand groups in the value (along with the existing top-level command). In the future. we recommend not relying on this message interaction field. The format of the value will be the different command levels (if they exist). separated by spaces: <command name<subcommand group name<subcommand name>. The name field is only seen on messages that are a response to an interaction without an existing message. so interaction objects for message components donâ€™t include this field.
