\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

The natural leakage of a SE scheme, access pattern, could compromise encrypted data if range injection attacks are implemented. Instead of completely hiding access pattern, which would require extremely high and unbearable costs with existing generic countermeasures (e.g., Oblivious RAM), we propose two novel and lightweight mechanisms to alleviate access pattern leakage and mitigate the impact of range injection attacks with affordable tradeoffs.
